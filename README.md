Dead simple programming language.
Not expected to be prepared for a real developer environment but can
be fun to work with.

## Philosophy

- Simple syntax.
- 'Low level' capabilities.
- C interoperability.
- Compiled with LLVM and typed.

## Installation and tutorials

Check docs/tutorials for an overview of the language!

## Building

- Go to cmd/build.
- Run `go build .`, the go version should be >= 1.18.

## Testing

- Run `go test .`, the go version should be >= 1.18.
